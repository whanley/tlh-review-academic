Ten years ago this month, outrage over police brutality was the catalyst for the Egyptian revolution of 2011. In this moment of outrage over police brutality in America, it is worth spending some time thinking about similarities and differences between the two situations.

In June 2010, police in Alexandria beat a young man named Khaled Said to death. He was neither the first nor the last victim of unpunished brutality. He was (probably) a small-time drug dealer. It is not entirely clear why his death was the catalyst for a movement. But a facebook group called "We are all Khaled Said" became the nerve center of protest.

That protest took the tone of "enough is enough," a tone familiar to anyone protesting in America today. And the discussion became one of tactics—Egyptian protestors had long memories of their calls for change being deflected and waited out. They were wary and desperately weary of such results, and laid careful plans for sustainability. Again, the parallels with America are clear. 

And in Egypt, change came. The revolution stirred the world. Unfortunately, with the "benefit" of a decade of hindsight, we see that the fears of protestors—that their claims would be smothered once the contingency of protest was waited out and their circumstances suppressed—came to pass. Egypt today is a grave for protest.

In America's Black Lives Matter movement, conditions are not the same, despite certain similarities. First, democracy in America has more substantial structures than those in Egypt (despite the endurance of institutions through the 1980s and 1990s and beyond). "The whole damn system is guilty as hell. Arrest, indict, send the killer cops to jail." I always find this protest chant absurd for its reliance on the very structures it condemns. Nevertheless, it appears that American structures may be responsive to reform and not only revolution.

In Egypt, a power struggle between the military and the police is a major feature of post-colonial state. This is not so true of the United States. There is a terrifying militarization of the police over the last decades, fuelled in large part by the materiel and culture of the disastrous Middle East wars. The tactics and mentality of experienced military occupiers are evident in the experience of protestors, who do not fail to make connections with occupied people in Palestine (for example). In Egypt, however, the military came first to save the people from the state’s police, and then to wrest the state itself from the hands of the people. That scenario, too, seems far off in America. Nevertheless, calls to demilitarize police and society seem wise and warranted.

One of the puzzles of Egypt’s revolution was information. It was difficult to assess how many were involved, and where the real centres of gravity lay in the protests and their repression. I myself am struck by constant contradictory messages I receive on social media about the local actions I join. The elections that followed on those protests (like the elections here in November) offered the clarity of a verdict that challenged the myopia of those in Tahrir (as the elections of 2016 challenged the myopia of “metropolitan elites”). We do well to question to quality of the information we receive. 

Ultimately, I am most inspired by the optimism at the heart of these bitter protests. In 2011 Egypt and 2020 America, ordinary people are calling in the promises that state and society made and disappointed. Failed promises poison everything. They also offer an avenue for action. We must resist the corruption of equality wherever we see it. Only this can redeem the promise of freedom, which will abide centuries of oppression.
