The Tallahassee Review publishes short topical writing addressed to a general audience. We aim to show connections between academic expertise and current events. The opinions expressed do not represent our employers or institutions.

Selected essays will be published on a newly established website, which will serve as a vital resource for anyone interested in learning more about this vibrant, though often conflicted and misunderstood, city. Submissions and questions should be directed to tallahassee-review@protonmail.com.

###  Submission guidelines
- We solicit writing from academics (including students) in and around Tallahassee.
- Submissions are limited to 1000 words in length.
- We encourage authors to submit their pieces for publication as op-eds in the Tallahassee Democrat.
- We encourage authors to submit images for publication alongside their text.
- Editors will proofread text and prepare it for publication; authors will approve the final rendering of their piece before publication.
- [publication license]
- Please include a link to your web presence (departmental homepage, social media) and tags indicating the topics of your pieces.
- Show references as hyperlinks in the body of the text. Do not use footnotes.
