Paul Renfro studies the political and cultural history of the United States since 1945, with thematic interests in gender/sexuality, the carceral state, and childhood and the family. His book, [*Stranger Danger: Family Values, Childhood, and the American Carceral State*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/stranger-danger-9780190913984?cc=us&lang=en&), was published by Oxford University Press in 2020.
