As Tallahassee continues to reckon with COVID-19 and the fallout from the fatal police shootings of Wilbon Cleveland Woodard, Mychael Johnson, and Tony McDade, the city’s past and present are ripe for critical examination. All Tallahasseeans — from the campuses of Florida A&M, Florida State, and Tallahassee Community College, to the city government, and beyond — carry invaluable knowledge of the city’s history, political economy, infrastructure, and culture.

As such, the Tallahassee Review — a collaborative project spearheaded by FSU’s Department of History — seeks written contributions illuminating some underexplored (or unexplored) component of the city’s past and present. Submissions should be 500 to 1,000 words in length and should be written in clear, accessible prose. Short essays that shed light on the political, economic, cultural, and social conditions that helped produce the Tallahassee of the twenty-first century are especially welcome.
